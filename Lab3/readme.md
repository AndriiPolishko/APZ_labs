# Lab#1

## How to run
To test this laboratory work you just need to run services in separate terminals
1. python3 ./server/facadeService.py
1. python3 ./server/loggingService.py
1. python3 ./server/messagesService.py
Then you need to choose client application. I've choosed Postman since it has really nice interface and it's very easy to use.
